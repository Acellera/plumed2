@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

Include all fixes in branch 2.0 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-0 .

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for users:
- New configuration system based on autoconf (use ./configure from root directory)
- Root-mean-square devations with align weights different from displace weights
  are now considerably faster. This will affect \ref RMSD calculations plus
  other variables based on RMSD.
- Added WALKERS_MPI to \ref METAD, allowing to run multiple walkers in a mpi-based multi-replica framework.
- Added ACCELERATION to \ref METAD, allowing to calculate on the fly the Metadynamics acceleration factor.
- Added option PRECISION to set number of digits in \ref DUMPATOMS.
- Added NDX_FILE and NDX_GROUP to action \ref GROUP, allowing to import atom lists from ndx files.
- Small optimization in \ref WHOLEMOLECULES
- Small optimization in \ref COORDINATION when NN and MM are even and D_0=0
- Faster atom scattering with domain decomposition.
- \ref SPRINT topological collective variables.
- \ref CH3SHIFTS collective variable.
- Improved multicolvar neighbor lists.
- Maximum colvar as well as minimum colvar is now possible.
- \ref COMMITTOR analysis.
- Added possibility to use negative strides in atom ranges (e.g. 10-1:-3).
- Added possibility to use \ref COORDINATION or \ref DHENERGY with NLIST in replica exchange simulations.
- Added STRETCH flag to \ref switchingfunction.
- Added possibility to read trajectories from \ref driver using VMD molfile
  plugin (requires VMD plugins to be compiled and installed)
- Simplified configuration with the possibility to use an internally compiled
  version of lapack and blas.

Changes from version 2.0 which are relevant for developers:
- Added regtests for plumed as a library (e.g. basic/rt-make-0). plumed command has an additional
  flag (--is-installed) to probe if running from a compilation directory or from a fully installed copy
  (this is needed for regtests to work properly).
- Improved class Communicator. Many operations can now be done directly on Vectors, Tensors, std::vector and PLMD::Matrix.
- Patches for GPL codes (QuantumEspresso and Gromacs) now also include
  original code so as to simplify their modification.
- Fixed dependencies among actions such that it is now possible (and reliable)
  to use MPI calls inside Action::prepare()
- colvar/CoordinationBase.cpp has been changed to make it faster. If you devised a class which inherits from here,
  consider that CoordinationBase::pairing now needs _squared_ distance instead of distance
- It is possible to run "make install" from subdirectories (e.g. from src/colvar)
- There is a small script which disables/enables all optional modules (make mod-light/mod-heavy/mod-reset)
- Added "-q" option to plumed patch
