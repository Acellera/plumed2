\page usingDoxygen Using doxygen to create plumed documentation

Plumed's documentation is created automatically from comments in the source code using the following packages:

- Doxygen:   http://www.doxygen.org
- Graphviz:  http://www.graphviz.org/ 

To create documentation you need only type it in the top part of your cpp source code files.  

\section sampleInput Creating sample input

You can create sample input by typing:

\verbatim
\verbatim
EXAMPLE - AN EXAMPLE INPUT LINE
\ endverbatim  /*** But with no space between the \ and the endverbatim
\endverbatim

which will put the following into the manual:

\verbatim 
EXAMPLE - AN EXAMPLE INPUT LINE
\endverbatim

\section formula Creating latex formulae

You can add formulae in latex using:

\verbatim
This is an inline equation \f$s=y+x\f$ but this is an equation:

\f[
r = \sqrt{ \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{C}^{-1} \mathbf{s} }
\f]

And this is an equation array:

\f{eqnarray*}{
 f &=& \frac{1}{2} \\
 g &=& \frac{2}{3}
\f}
\endverbatim

In the manual this will be translated into:

This is an inline equation \f$s=y+x\f$ but this is an equation:
 
\f[
r = \sqrt{ \mathbf{s}^T \mathbf{C}^{-1} \mathbf{s} }
\f]

And this is an equation array:

\f{eqnarray*}{
 f &=& \frac{1}{2} \\
 g &=& \frac{2}{3}
\f} 

\section lists Creating lists

You can create lists of data using: 

\verbatim
- First item in list
- Second item in list
\endverbatim

which becomes:

- First item in list
- Second item in list

\section formatting Formatting your documentation

You can create a new section in your documentation using:

\verbatim
\section formula Creating latex formulae
\endverbatim

In fact I used this very command earlier in writing this page.  I can therefore reference it here (\ref formula) by using:

\verbatim
\ref formula
\endverbatim

I can also reference external webpages by typing web addresses directly in my documentation.
