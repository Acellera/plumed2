REGRESSION TEST

If your system is configured and you compiled everything
just try the tests with
> make

To do many tests in parallel, as usual
> make -j 4

ATTENTION

!!!! Up to now it is only possible to do regtests with simplemd
!!!! As soon as possible we should add the possibility
!!!! of doing them with a driver

HOW TO ADD A NEW TEST

Add a new directory rtXXX, let's say rt105, and go there:
> cd rt105

Link the common makefile
> ln -s ../scripts/test.make ./Makefile

Put in the rt105 directory a "config" files as this one
> cat "type=simplemd" > config
Later, we will use it to enforce different types
of test (e.g. driver based)

Put in the rt105 directory all the input files that you need
(typically: in input.xyz plumed.dat)

Make:
> make

Copy from the newly generated tmp directory the files that you
want to check and rename them into xxx.reference
> cp rt5/COLVAR COLVAR.reference

Add to the git repository all the files in the rt105 directory,
but for report.txt and tmp directory:
> git add .
(this should work since report.txt and tmp are git-ignored)
In this manner, other people will be able to perform the test

HOW TO RESET A TEST
If you get an error from a test but you think that the new
result is the correct one, just go to its directory and type
> make reset
Then commit the modified references
