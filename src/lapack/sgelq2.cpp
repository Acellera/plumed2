/* +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
These files are semi-automatic translations by f2c from the original netlib LAPACK library.
The source has been modified to (mostly) use modern C formatting, and to get rid of
compiler warnings. Any errors in doing this should be blamed on the Gromacs developers, and
not the reference LAPACK implementation.

The reference LAPACK implementation is available from http://www.netlib.org/lapack 

LAPACK does not come with a formal named "license", but a general statement saying:

"The reference LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from netlib
via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. Thus, it can be included in commercial software
packages (and has been). We only ask that proper credit be given to the authors."

While the rest of Gromacs is LGPL, we think it's only fair to give you the same rights to
our modified LAPACK files as the original netlib versions, so do what you want with them.

However, be warned that we have only tested that they to the right thing in the cases used
in Gromacs (primarily full & sparse matrix diagonalization), so in most cases it is a much
better idea to use the full reference implementation.
