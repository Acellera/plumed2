\page Function Functions

The following keywords are available for all directives of this section:
- ARG:
  This keyword is used to specify on which variables the function is computed
  It is a comma-separated list of labels. Here is an example with \ref COMBINE
\verbatim
DISTANCE  ATOMS=1,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE  ATOMS=2,6 LABEL=d2
COMBINE   ARG=d1,d2 POWERS=2
\endverbatim

@FUNCTION@

\page Bias 

The following keywords are available for all directives of this section:

- ARG:
  This keyword is used to specify on which variables the bias is acting.
  It is a comma-separated list of labels. Here is an example with \ref RESTRAINT
\verbatim
DISTANCE  ATOMS=1,5 LABEL=d1
DISTANCE  ATOMS=2,6 LABEL=d2
RESTRAINT ARG=d1,d2 AT=5.0,6.0 KAPPA=100.0,50.0
\endverbatim
- STRIDE:
  PLUMED implements a multiple-time-step scheme. Using the keyword STRIDE
  one can set how frequently the bias should be applied, in units of time steps.
  It can be used to decrease the impact of variables which are computationally heavy.
  Here is an example with \ref RESTRAINT
\verbatim
DISTANCE  ATOMS=1,5 LABEL=d1
RESTRAINT ARG=d1 AT=5.0 KAPPA=100.0 STRIDE=2
\endverbatim
