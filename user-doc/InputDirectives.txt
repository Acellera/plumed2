\page InputDirectives Input manipulation

These are directives which can be used to manipulate the input file.

\section Comments

Comments can be added with # syntax
\verbatim
# This is the distance between two atoms:
DISTANCE ATOM=1,2 # this is ok
\endverbatim

\section ContinuationLines Continuation lines

Directives with many keywords can be splitted for convenience on multiple
lines using "..." syntax:
This:
\verbatim
DISTANCE ...
# we can insert also comments here
  ATOMS=1,300
# multiple kewords per line are allowed
  NOPBC COMPONENTS
#empty lines are allowed

... DISTANCE

\endverbatim
is equivalent to this:
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,300 NOPBC
\endverbatim

\section INCLUDE

Other files can be included with the INCLUDE directive.
\par Syntax
\verbatim
INCLUDE filename
\endverbatim

A single "plumed.dat" file:
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
RESTRAINTG ARG=dist
\endverbatim
can be equivalently splitted as
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
INCLUDE toBeIncluded.dat
\endverbatim
plus a "toBeIncluded.dat" file
\verbatim
RESTRAINTG ARG=dist
\endverbatim

Notice that this is a real directive and it is resolved after \ref Comments have been stripped 
and after \ContinuationLines have been unrolled. Thus it is not possible to do
something like:
\verbatim 
# this is wrong:
DISTANCE INCLUDE options.dat
RESTRAINTG ARG=dist
\endverbatim

\section LOAD

LOAD allows to load a shared library containing PLUMED extensions (e.g. new collective variables,
function or free energy methods).

\par Syntax
\verbatim
LOAD library.so
\endverbatim

Notice that plumed will automatically replace the suffix with the proper one for that system
(e.g. .dylib for mac, .so on linux).
Moreover, if the file has a .cpp extension it will be first compiled and
linked into a shared library then loaded.

\section ENDPLUMED

Reading is killed when the directive ENDPLUMED is found. Thus, subsequent
lines can be used to store comments or other unread information
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
ENDPLUMED
lines here are not parsed at all
\endverbatim
