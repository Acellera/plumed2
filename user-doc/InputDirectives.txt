/**

\page InputDirectives Input directives

These are directives which can be used to manipulate the input file.

\section Comments

Comments can be added with # syntax
\verbatim
# This is the distance between two atoms:
DISTANCE ATOM=1,2
\endverbatim

\section ContinuationLines Continuation lines

Directives with many keywords can be splitted for convenience on multiple
lines using "..." syntax:
This:
\verbatim
DISTANCE ...
  ATOMS=1,300
  NOPBC
... DISTANCE
\endverbatim
is equivalent to this:
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,300 NOPBC
\endverbatim

\section INCLUDE

Other file can be included with the INCLUDE directive. A single "plumed.dat"
file:
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
RESTRAINTG ARG=dist
\endverbatim
can be equivalently splitted as
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
INCLUDE toBeIncluded.dat
\endverbatim
plus a "toBeIncluded.dat" file
\verbatim
RESTRAINTG ARG=dist
\endverbatim

\section LOAD

[How to load external dynamic libraries]

\section ENDPLUMED

Reading is killed when the directive ENDPLUMED is found. Thus, subsequent
lines can be used to store comments or other unread information
\verbatim
DISTANCE ATOMS=0,1 LABEL=dist
ENDPLUMED
lines here are not parsed
\endverbatim
