\section Patching Patching your MD code

To patch your MD code, you should have PLUMED already installed and properly
working. In particular, you should have the command "plumed" in your execution
path. Then, follow these steps
- Configure and compile your MD enginge
- Test if it is working properly
- Go to the root diretory of the MD engine
- Patch:
\verbatim
> plumed patch -p
\endverbatim
The script will interactively ask which MD engine you are patching.
- Recompile the MD code (if dependencies are set up properly in the MD engine,
  only modified files will be recompiled)

If your MD code is not supported, you may want to implement an interface for
it. Refer to the <a href="../../developer-doc/html/index.html"> developer
manual </a>.
