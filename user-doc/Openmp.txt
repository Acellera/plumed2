\page Openmp OpenMP

OpenMP support is still experimental in PLUMED. To
enable it you should configure using flag "--enable-openmp".
Additionally, at runtime, you should set the environment variable
PLUMED_NUM_THREADS to the number of threads you wish to use with PLUMED.
By default (if PLUMED_NUM_THREADS is unset) openmp will be disabled at
runtime. E.g., to run with gromacs you should do:
\verbatim
export PLUMED_NUM_THREADS=8
mdrun -plumed
\endverbatim

Notice that:
- This option is likely to improve the performance, but could also slow down
  the code in some case.
- Results could be slightly different because of numerical roundoff and
  different order in summations. This should be harmless.
- The optimum number of threads is not necessary "all of them", nor should be
  equal to the number of threads used to parallelize MD.
- Only a few CVs are parallelized with opemMP (currently, COORDINATION and
  DHENERGY).
- You might want to tune also the environmental variable PLUMED_CACHELINE_SIZE, 
  by default 512, to set the size of cachelines on your machine. This is used
  by PLUMED to decrease the number of threads to be used in each loop so as to
  avoid clashes in memory access. This variable is expected to affect
  performance only, not results.
