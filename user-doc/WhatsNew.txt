\section NewFeatures List of new features

- Input file (plumed.dat) syntax is much more flexible and has more 
  error checking (see \ref NewInputSyntax). Units are treated
  consistently, so that the plumed.dat file can be ported from on
  MD code to another.
- Plumed is now compiled as a library, independently of the MD code.
  This simplifies the patching procedure. Moreover, on systems where
  this is possible, plumed library will be loaded runtime. This will
  allow updating plumed without recompiling the MD code.
- Interfacing with MD codes is simpler. Hopefully, in the future, these
  interface will be maitained by the developers of the MD codes
  independently from plumed developers. This will allow more MD codes
  to be compatible with plumed.
- It is now possible to develop and release collective variables,
  free energy methods and other addons independently from plumed
  developers. This will allow more collective variables and
  free energy methods to be available.
- ...

Caveats:
- Plumed 2 input file (plumed.dat) has a syntax which is not
  compatible with Plumed 1 (see \ref NewInputSyntax).
  Transition should be easy, but cannot
  be done just using the new version with the old input file.
- Plumed 2 is written in C++, thus requires a C++ compiler
- Plumed 2 may not include all the features that were available
  in plumed 1.
