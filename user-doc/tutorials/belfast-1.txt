\section Instructions

PLUMED2 is a library that can be accessed by multiple codes adding a relatively simple and well documented interface.
Once PLUMED is installed you can run a plumed executable that can be used for multiple purposes:

\verbatim
plumed --help 
\endverbatim

some of the listed options report about the plumed available functionalities, other can be used to tell plumed to do something:
from analysing a trajectory to patch the source code of a MD code and so on. All the commands have further options that can
be seen using plumed command --help, i.e.:

\verbatim
plumed driver --help
\endverbatim

In the following we are going to see how to write an input file for plumed2 that can be used to analyse a trajectory.

\subsection Introduction to PLUMED input file

A typical input file for PLUMED input is composed by specification of one or more CVs, the printout frequency and a termination line.

\verbatim
#my first plumed input:
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,15 LABEL=cvdist

#printout frequency
PRINT ARG=cvdist STRIDE=1 FILE=COLVAR 

#endofinput 
ENDPLUMED
here I can write what I want it won't be read.
\endverbatim

In PLUMED2 the actions defined in the input files are executed in the same order in which they are written: this means that the
following input file is wrong:

\verbatim
#printout frequency
PRINT ARG=cvdist STRIDE=1 FILE=COLVAR 
#my first plumed input:
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,15 LABEL=cvdist
#endofinput 
ENDPLUMED
here I can write what I want it won't be read.
\endverbatim



Now we can use this simple input file to analyse the trajectory included in the RESOURCES:

\verbatim
plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --ixyz trajectory-short.xyz --pdb template.pdb --length-units 0.1
\endverbatim


#! FIELDS time cvdist
 0.000000 2.5613161


LOOK AT COLVAR AND GNUPLOT

LABELS and PRINTING OPTIONS (MULTIPLE FILES, FORMAT)


\verbatim
#my first plumed input:
DISTANCE ATOMS=1,15 LABEL=cvdist

#printout frequency
PRINT ARG=cvdist STRIDE=1 FILE=COLVAR 

#endofinput 
ENDPLUMED
here I can write what I want it won't be read.
\endverbatim

CENTRE OF MASSES -> DISTANCE, TORSION, ANGLE

GROUP OF ATOMS -> GYRATION



MULTICOLVAR (DISTANCE
