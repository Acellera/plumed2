\page belfast-4 Belfast tutorial: Umbrella sampling

\section belfast-4-aims Aims

In the previous lectures we learned how to compute collective variables (CVs)
from atomic positions. We will now learn how one can add a bias potential
to enforce the exploration of a particular region of the space.
We will also see how it is possible to bias CVs
so as to enhance the sampling of events hindered by
large free-energy barriers and how to analyze this kind of simulation.
This technique is known as "umbrella sampling" and can be used
in combination with the weighted-histogram analysis method to compute
free-energy landscapes.
In this tutorial we will use simple
collective variables, but the very same approach can be used with 
any kind of collective variable.

\section belfast-4-learning-outcomes Learning Outcomes

Once this tutorial is completed students will:

- Know how to setup simulations with restraints
- Know how to use multiple-restraint umbrella sampling simulations
  to enhance the transition across a free-energy barrier.
- Analyze the results.

\subsection belfast-4-system The model system

We here use a a model system
alanine dipeptide with AMBER99SB-ILDN all atom force field already seen in the previous section.
Here you can see its free-energy landscape depicted as function of the two dihedral angles \f$phi\f$ and
\f$\psi\f$ (also called "Ramachandan plot").

\subsection belfast-4-restrained-simulations Restrained simulations

The simplest way in which one
might inﬂuence a CV is by forcing the system to stay close to a chosen
value during the simulation. This is achieved with a restraining potential
that PLUMED provides via the directive \ref RESTRAINT.
In the umbrella sampling method a bias potential is added so as
to favor the exploration of some regions of the conformational space
and to disfavor the exploration of other regions \cite torrie-valleau . A properly
chosen bias potential could allow for example to favor
the transition state sampling thus enhancing the transition state
for a conformational transition. However, choosing such a potential
is not trivial. In a later section we will see how metadynamics
can be used to this aim. The simplest way to use umbrella sampling
is that to apply harmonic constraints to one or more CVs.

As first example we perform an umbrella sampling calculation of the free energy landscape of
alanine dipeptide with AMBER99SB-ILDN all atom force field already seen in the previous section.
depicted as function of the two dihedral angles \f$phi\f$ and 
\f$\psi\f$ (also called "Ramachandan plot").
We will now see how to enforce the exploration of a the neighborhood of a selected point
the CV space using a \ref RESTRAINT potential.

\verbatim
# set up two variables for Phi and Psi dihedral angles 
phi: TORSION ATOMS=5,7,9,15
psi: TORSION ATOMS=7,9,15,17
#
# Impose an umbrella potential on CV 1 and CV 2
# with a spring constant of 500 kjoule/mol
# at fixed points on the Ramachandran plot
#
restraint-phi: RESTRAINT ARG=phi KAPPA=500 AT=pi
restraint-psi: RESTRAINT ARG=psi KAPPA=500 AT=-pi

# monitor the two variables and the bias potential from the two restraints
PRINT STRIDE=10 ARG=phi,psi,restraint-phi.bias,restraint-psi.bias FILE=COLVAR

\endverbatim
(see \ref TORSION, \ref RESTRAINT, and \ref PRINT).

The syntax for the command \ref RESTRAINT is rather trivial.
The directive is followed by a keyword ARG followed by the label of the CV
on which the umbrella potential has to act.
The keyword KAPPA determines the hardness of the spring constant and its units are
[Energy units]/[Units of the CV ]. The additional potential introduced by the UMBRELLA takes the form of
a simple Hooke’s law:
\f[
  U(s)=\frac{k}{2} (x-x_0)^2
\f].

where \f$ x_0 \f$  is the value specified following the AT keyword.
The CVs as well as the sum of the two bias potentials are shown in the COLVAR file.
For this specific input the COLVAR file has in first column the time,
in the second the value of \f$\phi\f$, in the third the value of \f$\psi\f$,
in the fourth the the additional potential introduced by the restraint on \f$\phi\f$ and in
the fifth the additional potential introduced by the restraint on \f$\psi\f$.

It may happen that one wants that a given CV just stay
within a given range of values. This is achieved in plumed through the
directives \ref UPPER_WALLS and \ref LOWER_WALLS that act on speciﬁc collective variables and
limit the exploration within given ranges.

\subsection belfast-4-comments-1 How does PLUMED work

The fact that when you add a force on the collective variable
PLUMED can force the atoms to do something depends on the fact that
the collective variables implemented in PLUMED has analytical
derivatives. By biasing the value of a single CV one turns to aﬀect
the time evolution of the system itself. Notice that some of the collective
variables could be implemented without derivatives (either because the
developers were lazy or because the CVs cannot be derived).
In this case you might want to have a look at the NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES
option.
