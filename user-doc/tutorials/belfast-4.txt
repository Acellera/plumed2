\page belfast-4 Belfast tutorial: Umbrella sampling

Once you deﬁne a bunch of collective variables of your interests PLUMED
has a number of ways in which you may aﬀect their behavior. The fact
that you can actually inﬂuence their value depends on the fact that
each of the collective variables implemented in PLUMED has analytical
derivatives and, by biasing the value of a single CV one turns to aﬀect
the time evolution of the system itself. The simplest way in which one
might inﬂuence a CV is by forcing the system to stay close to a chosen
value during the simulation. This is achieved with umbrella potential
that plumed provides via the directive \ref RESTRAINT.
Very often it may happen that one wants that a given CV just stay
within a given range of values. This is achieved in plumed through the
directives \ref UPPER_WALLS and \ref LOWER_WALLS that act on speciﬁc collective variables and
limit the exploration within given ranges.
Another useful strategy is the \ref MOVINGRESTRAINT directive. It allows to
perform a series of programmed steered runs and can be helpful in
performing adaptive umbrella sampling or multievent reaction within
a single simulation.
