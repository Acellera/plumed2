\page belfast-5 Belfast tutorial: Steered MD

Steered molecular dynamics can be performed in PLUMED on any
collective variable by means of the \ref MOVINGRESTRAINT directive.
This directive is very flexible and allows for a programmed series
of steerings and can be used also to sample multiple events
within a single simulation.
