\page belfast-6 Belfast tutorial: Metadynamics

\section Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce the users to running a metadynamics calculation using plumed. We will set up
a simple calculation on alanine dipeptide in vacuum, analize the output, and calculate free energies
from the simulation. We will also learn how to run a well-tempered metadynamics simulation and 
detect issues related to a bad choice of collective variables.

\section belfast-6-lo Learning Outcomes

Once this tutorial is completed students will:

- Know how to run a metadynamics calculation using plumed 
- Know how to analyse the output of the simulation
- Know how to restart a metadynamics calculation
- Know how to calculate free energies from a metadynamics calculation
- Know how to run a well-tempered metadynamics calculation using plumed
- Know how to detect issues with the choice of the collective variables

\section Resources

The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23916760/belfast-6.tar.gz" download="belfast-6.tar.gz"> tarball </a> for this project contains the following directories:

- TOPO: it contains the gromacs topology and configuration files to simulate the alanine dipeptide in vacuum  
- Exercise_1_2: run a metadynamics simulation with 2 CVs, dihedral phi and psi
- Exercise_3: restart a metadynamics simulation
- Exercise_4: calculate free energies from a metadynamics simulation and monitor the convergence
- Exercise_5: run a well-tempered metadynamics simulation with 2 CVs, dihedral phi and psi
- Exercise_6: run a well-tempered metadynamics simulation with 1 CV, dihedral psi
