/**
\page belfast-9 Belfast tutorial: NMR constraints

\section Aims
This tutorial is about the use of experimental data, in particular NMR data, either as collective variables or as replica-averaged
restraints in MD simulations. While the first is a just a simple extension of what we have been already doing in previous tutorials,
the latter is an approach that can be used to increase the quality of a force-field in describing the properties of a specific system.

\section belfast-9-lo Learning Outcomes

Once this tutorial is completed students will:
- know multiple ways of using experimental data in MD simulations
- know how to use replica-averaged restrained MD simulations

\subsection expdata Experimental data as Collective Variables

In the former tutorials it has been often discussed the possibility of measuring a distance with respect to a structure representing
some kind of state for a system, i.e. \ref belfast-5. An alternative possibility is to use as a reference a set of experimental data
that represent a state and measure the current deviation from the set. In plumed there are currently implemented the following NMR
experimental observables: Chemical Shifts (only for proteins) \ref CS2BACKBONE and \ref CH3SHIFTS, \ref NOE distances and Residual Dipolar
couplings \ref RDC. In addition \ref NOE collective variable can be also used for PRE distances and 3J Couplings will be implemented
shortly. Among the above listed collective variables those based on chemical shifts make use of an external library, ALMOST, that  must
be downloaded and compiled separately. In addition plumed must be configured in such a way to link ALMOST. Detailed instructions on how
to compile PLUMED with ALMOST can be found in \ref CS2BACKBONE.

In the following we will write the CS2BACKBONE collective variable that has been used in Gratana et al. (2013).

\verbatim
prot: GROUP ATOMS=1-862
WHOLEMOLECULES ENTITY0=prot

cs: CS2BACKBONE ATOMS=prot DATA=data FF=a03_gromacs.mdb NRES=56 FLAT=1.0 WRITE_CS=50 



PRINT ARG=cs FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=100

ENDPLUMED
\endverbatim 



\subsection replica Replica-Averaged Restrained Simulations 

NMR data, as all the equilibrium experimental data, are the result of a measure over an ensemble of structures and over time.
In principle a "perfect" molecular dynamics simulations, that is a simulations with a perfect force-field and a perfect sampling
can predict the outcome of an experiments in a quantitative way. Actually in most of the cases obtaining a qualitative agreement
is already a lucky outcome.
