\section Aims

The aim of this document is to describe the PLUMED tutorial held in Munster, March 2015.
Syntax is consistent with PLUMED 2.1. Simulations are made using GROMACS, which is expected to
be already installed.

\section munster-monitor Monitoring collective variables

The main scope of PLUMED is to compute collective variables, that is complex descriptors than can be used
to analyze a conformational change or a chemical reaction. This can be done either on the fly, that is during
molecular dynamics, or a posteriori, using PLUMED as a post-processing tool. In both cases
one should create an input file with a specific PLUMED syntax. A sample input file is below:

\verbatim
# compute distance between atoms 1 and 10
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,10
# compute torsional angle between atoms 1,10,20,30
phi: TORSION ATOMS=1,10,20,30
# print both of them every 10 step
PRINT ARG=d,phi STRIDE=10
\endverbatim
(see \ref DISTANCE, \ref TORSION, and \ref PRINT)

PLUMED works using kJ/nm/ps as energy/length/time units. This can be personalized using \ref UNITS.
Notice that variables should be given a name (in the example above, 'd' and 'phi'), which is
then used to refer to these variables. Also notice that lists of atoms should be provided as 
comma separated numbers, with no space. You can find more information on the PLUMED syntax
at \ref Syntax page of the manual. A complete documentation for all the supported
collective variables can be found at the \ref colvarintro page.

\subsection munster-monitor-of Analyze on the fly

Here we will run a plain MD on alanine dipeptide and compute two torsional angles on the fly.

TODO:
- instructions on running gromacs
- input monitoring phi and psi
- run two trajectories starting from the two different minima
- (optional) compute histogram
- (optional) an example with \ref MATHEVAL

\subsection munster-monitor-dr Analyze using the driver

Analyze phi and psi with the \ref driver.

TODO:
- instructions on running the driver
- compute another variable (e.g. \ref GYRATION)
- explain how to use \ref WHOLEMOLECULES

\section munster-biasing Biasing collective variables

We have seen that PLUMED can be used to compute collective variables. However, PLUMED
is most often use to add forces on the collective variables. To this aim,
we have implemented a variety of possible biases acting on collective variables.
A bias works in a manner conceptually similar to the \ref PRINT command, taking as argument
one or more collective variables. However, here the STRIDE is usually set to 1, which means
that forces are applied at every timestep. In the following we will see how to apply harmonic restraints
and haw to build an adaptive bias potential with metadynamics.

\subsection munster-biasing-re Using restraints

TODO:
- instructions for using \ref RESTRAINT on phi
- instructions for using \ref MOVINGRESTRAINT perhaps bringing phi from one basin to the other

\subsection munster-biasing-me Metadynamics

TODO:
- instructions for using  \ref METAD on phi,psi
- show how to compute the landscape with \ref sum_hills
- (optional) show metadynamics failure with \ref GYRATION

\section munster-rex Using multiple replicas

Some free-energy methods are intrinsically parallel and requires running
several simultaneous simulations. (expand).

\subsection munster-rex-wham Using multiple restraints with replica exchange

(is this section a good idea or analysis is going to be too complicated?)

\subsection munster-rex-ptmetad Using metadynamics with parallel tempering

TODO:
- show metadynamics working properly with \ref GYRATION
